# IESCP-AppDev-Proect
IIT Madras Application development project.

Built a platform to connect sponsors and influencers for advertising campaigns.
• Sponsors can manage campaigns, send ad requests, and track progress, while influencers can accept, reject, or
negotiate requests.
• Implemented role-based access control (Admin, Sponsor, Influencer) using Flask, with distinct functionalities for each role.
• Integrated SQLite for data storage, Redis for caching, and Celery for background tasks like reminders and reports.
• Optimized API performance with caching and developed a responsive UI using VueJS and Bootstrap.
• Automated CSV exports and email reports for sponsors and integrated Mailhog for notifications.
